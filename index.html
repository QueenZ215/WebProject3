            <h2>Baldur's Gate—Halfway to Everywhere</h2>
            <p>Or just “The Gate” if you're in a hurry—is one of the biggest, busiest, and bloodiest cities along the Sword Coast.
            It's jam-packed with traders, travelers, and troublemakers, all chasing coin or trying to dodge the Flaming Fist.
            Despite being officially neutral, the city's leaders still roll with the Lords' Alliance—because politics, obviously.</p>
            <p>Between the city Watch and the muscle-for-hire known as the Flaming Fist, things stay mostly under control.
                That's probably why the place draws such a wild mix: from high-rolling merchants to desperate refugees, and plenty of pirates and smugglers who just haven't gotten caught yet.
                Everyone's welcome, more or less—just don't cause too much chaos, or do it quietly.</p>
