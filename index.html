            <h2>Baldur's Gate—Halfway to Everywhere</h2>
            <p>Or just “The Gate” if you're in a hurry—is one of the biggest, busiest, and bloodiest cities along the Sword Coast.
            It's jam-packed with traders, travelers, and troublemakers, all chasing coin or trying to dodge the Flaming Fist.
            Despite being officially neutral, the city's leaders still roll with the Lords' Alliance—because politics, obviously.</p>
            <p>Between the city Watch and the muscle-for-hire known as the Flaming Fist, things stay mostly under control.
                That's probably why the place draws such a wild mix: from high-rolling merchants to desperate refugees, and plenty of pirates and smugglers who just haven't gotten caught yet.
                Everyone's welcome, more or less—just don't cause too much chaos, or do it quietly.</p>

                <p>The Upper City is where Baldur's Gate puts on its best face—clean, rich, and very well-guarded. This is where the Patriars live, and it shows: wide streets, fancy buildings with ivy or flowers hanging off every edge, and enough lanterns to light up the night like it's always festival season. It's probably the safest part of the city, too, thanks to the Watch constantly making their rounds.</p>
                <p>It's split into four central districts: Citadel Streets, Manorborn, the Temples District, and the Wide.</p>

                <p>The Lower City is the noisy, bustling heart of Baldur's Gate, packed tight inside the city walls like it's afraid to spill over. The streets twist and turn between tall, skinny buildings, with even skinnier alleys threading between them—always full of people shouting, hauling goods, or just trying to get somewhere in a hurry. If there's a job to do or a deal to strike, it's probably happening here.</p>
                <p>The Lower City breaks into six districts: Seatower, Bloomridge, the Steeps, Heapside, Eastway, and Brampton.</p>

                <p>Wyrm's Crossing is less a bridge and more a chaotic little city built over the River Chionthar. It stretches out from Wyrm's Rock in both directions, with shops, stalls, and businesses stacked high and clinging to its sides—some of them looking like they're one gust away from a swim. You'll find everything from towering trade houses to rickety vendor carts, all crammed together above the water.</p>
                <p>The whole thing rests on massive stone arches tall enough for ships to sail through, and it's wide enough that travelers can walk the road straight into Baldur's Gate while still ducking in and out of shops along the way.</p>

                <p>Under Baldur's Gate lies a hidden world that most surface-dwellers will never see—and honestly, might not want to. The first layer down is the Undercellar: a winding maze of musty cellars, secret tunnels, and shady backrooms tucked beneath the Upper City. It's part speakeasy, part underworld marketplace, and entirely controlled by the folks who know how to keep doors locked and mouths shut—whether they're merchants or mobsters.</p>
                <p>Go even deeper and you'll hit the Undercity, a half-forgotten ruin buried in the dark. Only one structure still stands: an old temple of Bhaal, once taken over by Sarevok, the infamous Bhaalspawn. The rest? Just crumbling stone and restless undead.</p>
                <p>The tunnels don't stop there. They go way down—deep enough to hit the Underdark. One passage even opens into a vast cavern called the Wizard Cave, where a tower still stands, long abandoned after its owner mysteriously vanished. Because, of course, he did.</p>

                <p>The Outer City is Baldur's Gate's messy, muddy sprawl beyond the walls—where rules are loose, taxes are high, and city officials mostly pretend they're in charge. It's a patchwork of shacks, stockyards, lean-tos, and whatever else people could throw together for a roof. The streets never really sleep, and the whole place hums with the constant buzz of animals, trade, and survival. It technically falls under the Grand Dukes' rule, but out here, you're mostly on your own.</p>
                <p>The Outer City is split into nine rough-and-tumble districts: Blackgate (just north of the Black Dragon Gate), Stonyeyes, Norchapel, Little Calimshan, Whitkeep, Sow's Foot, Twin Songs, Tumbledown (stretching south from Cliffgate), and Rivington, which hugs the road south of Wyrm's Crossing.</p>
