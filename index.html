            <h2>Baldur's Gate—Halfway to Everywhere</h2>
            <p>Or just “The Gate” if you're in a hurry—is one of the biggest, busiest, and bloodiest cities along the Sword Coast.
            It's jam-packed with traders, travelers, and troublemakers, all chasing coin or trying to dodge the Flaming Fist.
            Despite being officially neutral, the city's leaders still roll with the Lords' Alliance—because politics, obviously.</p>
            <p>Between the city Watch and the muscle-for-hire known as the Flaming Fist, things stay mostly under control.
                That's probably why the place draws such a wild mix: from high-rolling merchants to desperate refugees, and plenty of pirates and smugglers who just haven't gotten caught yet.
                Everyone's welcome, more or less—just don't cause too much chaos, or do it quietly.</p>

                <p>The Upper City of Baldur's Gate radiated wealth and beauty, serving as home to the city's Patriar class. It had wide, well-lit streets and attractive buildings decorated with hanging plants. The amenity of the Upper City was only matched by its well-kept safety, largely thanks to the regular patrols maintained by the Watch.</p>
                <p>The region consisted of four districts: Citadel Streets, Manorborn, the Temples District and the Wide.</p>

                <h3>Wyrm's Crossing</h3>
                <p>Wyrm's Crossing was the great double-bridge that spanned the River Chionthar, which extended north and south from the island-fortress of Wyrm's Rock. A myriad of different buildings were constructed on top of the crossing: from elaborate, several-story mercantile shops to small vendor stalls and even precariously-built businesses that hung off the side of the stone bridge, overlooking the waters of the Chionthar.</p>
                <p>The bridge stood atop massive arches that allowed ample room for sea traffic to pass unhindered. It was wide enough to allow overland travelers to pass through its many buildings, along the road that led into Baldur's Gate proper.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="under">
                <h3>Underground</h3>
                <p>Beneath the streets of the city was a sprawling, underground feasthall known as the Undercellar. Dank cellars, twisting corridors and cramped tunnels composed its extensive network that stretched beneath nearly every corner of the Upper City region. Entrances into this secretive domain were numerous, but well-controlled, either by private, mercantile or criminal enterprises.</p>
                <p>Even deeper underground, beyond the Undercellar, was a series of subterranean tunnels and caves. Within one of the vast caverns were the ruins of an old settlement that came to be known as the Undercity. By the 14th century only one structure remained amongst the decrepit foundations and undead-infested streets. This was an old temple of Bhaal that was once reclaimed by the Bhaalspawn Sarevok.</p>
                <p>These tunnels extended further down, under the surface of Toril, going so far as to connect to the Underdark. One of these natural formations opened up into the Wizard Cave, an expanse that housed the tower of a wizard that went missing during the mid-15th century.</p>

            <section id="outer">
                <h3> Outer City</h3>
                <p>The Outer City of Baldur's Gate was a sprawling, chaotic shantytown that grew outside of the city's walls. Day and night blended together throughout the lean-to's, stockyards and other shacks and lined the Outer City's muddy streets. While the animal-handlers, merchant-hawkers and other "outsiders" were taxed and technically "ruled" over by the Grand Dukes, city officials did little to truly govern the unregulated Outer City.</p>
                <p>It had nine districts, most of which encircled Dusthawk Hill: Blackgate, located north from the Black Dragon Gate, Stonyeyes, Norchapel, Little Calimshan, Whitkeep, Sow's Foot, Twin Songs, Tumbledown, which extended south from the Cliffgate, and Rivington, south of Wyrm's Crossing.</p>
